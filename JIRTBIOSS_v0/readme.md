JIRTBIOSS - Java Image Recognition Toolkit for Biosecurity - Is a software developed as my initial phase of Master of Computer Science thesis with its purpose being to enable processing of large number of images faster and efficiently. JIRTBIOSS server as front end for the Automated Object recognition (Animal detection) model to be developed in my thesis.

The software allows users to label images and store the labels into the database, there is also reporting functionality which allows users to extract specific information about images, e.g display all kangaroo images or extract image meta data including class labels and export to csv file.

Future integration include using openCV java wrapper to extract features from images and save the image feature vector into a database or csv file.

As an integral component of the wider discipline of systems engineering, CM’s primary function is to provide and maintain an accurate status of the approved configuration of all technical equipment, as well as the incorporation status of all configuration changes throughout the lifecycle. The CM system must effectively support the management of seaworthiness and the provision of effective logistics support of all maritime equipment

KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF EFFECTIVE CM
1) Understanding CM Value
2) Monitor and improve CM process
3) Persue CM technical mastery
4) Communication
5) Adthere to the CM process
6) Manage CM priorities

WHAT IS CONFIGURATION CHANGE
Changes to the current approved configuration result from additions or alterations to the design affecting the functions, performance, physical build or usage envelope of an item, system or installation. These include:
1) the introduction of new items or systems, and removal of superseded items or systems to enhance capability or resolve a technical deficiency;
2) modifications to existing items resulting from a capability or technical deficiency;
3) Changes to the operational usage of the item that exceed the original design specifications;
4) the introduction of alternative or superseding items or parts;
5) the upgrading of software, including embedded software as may be found in data interfaces, sonar and radar systems;
6) introduction of new or additional role equipment, including weapons; and
7) approval of new standard repairs.

WHAT OF CM ACTIVITIES THAT DO NOT RESULT CHANGE TO APPROVED CONFIGURATION
1) approved variances to the configuration documentation;
2) changes to servicing or other maintenance procedures, provided these do not vary the approved performance requirements, e.g. testing to a lower standard;
3) extension or reduction of a maintenance interval;
4) role equipment being fitted or removed, within approved combinations (i.e. within approved space, weight ad mission-requirement combinations); or
5) incorporation of a standard repair.

WHAT ARE THE KEY CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESS IN CONFIG

APP  MAIN MODULES    -- REFERENCE https://www.sharetribe.com/how-to-develop/marketplace-app/
1) BACKEND
The marketplace backend. The backend is your marketplace’s beating heart. It’s where user-generated data is stored in a database and where your transaction engine with all user functionality lives. In chapter two of this article, I’ll list all the essential features your backend should power and outline the general project flow of building a marketplace app from scratch.

2) ADMIN UI
The Admin UI. Think of your admin UI as something between your marketplace backend and your user interface. It reports all your marketplace activity and lets you monitor and manage users, notifications, messages, transactions, and reviews. The admin features need to be built in the backend, and they’ll need a graphical user interface, too.The Admin UI. Think of your admin UI as something between your marketplace backend and your user interface. It reports all your marketplace activity and lets you monitor and manage users, notifications, messages, transactions, and reviews. The admin features need to be built in the backend, and they’ll need a graphical user interface, too.

3)USER UI
   The User Interface. The UI is the branded and beautifully designed website or mobile app that your users interact with. You need different sections and features for sellers and customers, listing pages, user profiles, and content pages. The User Interface can be a web application (used through the browser with a desktop, tablet, or phone) or a native mobile application (downloaded through an app store). 

APP FEATURES
1. Account & user profile management
Features needed:

Sign in
Login
Email integration
Verify email
Forgot password
Change email
Ban account
Delete account
GDPR-compliance
Social logins (Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Github, etc.)
User profiles (First name, last name, bio)
Additional profile information
Upload profile picture
On a marketplace, both sellers and buyers typically have accounts and user profiles. So, you’ll need a standard sign-up and profile creation flow for both user groups. You’ll also need to store the account info in a way that is secure and compliant with local legal requirement

2. Listing management
   Features needed:

Basic listing information: title, description, price
Additional fields 
Update and delete listings
Close listings
Draft listings
Listing approval
Upload listing images
Listing geolocation
Pricing information
Listing variations
Listings are, essentially, the product that your marketplace offers. You’ll want them to be informative, appealing, and complete so you can maximize conversions.

3. Search & discoverability
   Features needed:
Map
Location search
Location auto-complete
Listing categories
Filtered search
Keyword search
Availability search
If marketplace customers won’t find what they’re looking for on your marketplace, none of your other features really matters. Here’s a thorough article that might help you design your marketplace discovery. 

4. Transaction process
   On-site messaging tools
Notifications (email integration/SMS integration/push notifications)
Pricing options (fixed/dynamic/seasonal/negotiation, add-ons)
Cancellation policies
Automatic expiration
Charging a commission
Delayed payouts and refund management
Invoicing
Reviews after transaction
Taxes
PDF receipts
Instead of designing and implementing just one type of process, I strongly recommend building a “transaction engine” where multiple different versions of your transaction process can progress at the same time. More on that in chapter 3.7.

Designing a transaction flow means defining the stages of user interaction (e.g. making a booking request, accepting it, and leaving a review) and transaction outcomes (e.g. successful, rejected, or cancelled). 

5. Payment integration
   Features needed:

Choose a payment gateway with support for the geographies, payment methods, and currencies you need
Build an integration with the help of Redirect URLs and Return URLs, Webhooks, or API access.
Seller-onboarding flow that fulfills Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements
Authorize and capture payments
Handle 3D Security / Strong Customer Authentication
Refund
Delayed payout
Split payment between the seller and the marketplace
Marketplace payments are subject to all kinds of regulation that traditional eCommerce avoids. With eCommerce, there's only one entity that receives payouts: the shop owner. On a marketplace, all the sellers receive payouts. 

In the world of online payments, paying money is easy, but payouts are hard. Payouts are subject to all kinds of regulation, anti-money-laundering legislation, and fraud-prevention measures. Global payouts are especially challenging. To make things even more complicated, most marketplaces also need to split every payment from a customer. One part of that payment goes to the seller as a payout, and another to the marketplace as the service fee.

6. Booking and Availability
   Features needed:

Booking calendar for buyers
Availability management calendar for sellers
Support for different time zones
Handle Daylight Savings changes etc.
Stock management
Seats
Ability to filter search by availability
The marketplace with the best-quality supply is the marketplace that wins over the customers. To make your marketplace defensible against competitors, give your sellers powerful features to manage their offering

7. Admin features
   Features needed:

Intuitive Admin UI
User search
User account status
User management
Managing products or services that are being sold
Access to all user-generated content
Access to messages
Ability to manage transactions
Notification management
And more.
On the best marketplaces, the admin console is almost like an app of its own. Your admin features help you manage activity, learn about your users, and identify improvement areas where you can boost conversion, transaction quality, and retention.

8. Marketing and Com
   Features needed:

Email integration 
SEO
CRM
The exact marketing and communications features you need will depend on your marketplace idea and audience. 

9. Hosting, monitoring, security
Features needed:


Hosting (e.g. AWS or Heroku)
Maintenance
Performance monitoring
Error tracking
Logging
Alerting when the app is unavailable / performing slowly
Audit logs
Security and privacy
Scalable data storage
Auto-scaling (or at least ability to manually scale your infrastructure in case of traffic spikes)
On a marketplace that reaches a meaningful scale, maintenance work is daily. Sooner or later, you’ll need a full-time DevOps person to manage your architecture and maintain and update configurations and integrations. You’ll also need a robust security and performance monitoring system in place. If something goes wrong at 2 AM, someone needs to get an alert, get up, and handle the situation.

You’ll also need an infrastructure with auto-scaling support, or at least the ability to manually scale up your servers quickly in the case of traffic spikes. If your marketplace goes viral but your site is unavailable because your servers can't handle the load, you might miss a once-in-a-lifetime chance.


CHOOSING TECH STACK
1. Front end tech
   -> React && bootstrap
3. Backend tech
  -> NodeJs & Express
  ->  A relational SQL database is a safe choice. The frameworks tend to have good support for SQL databases out of the box. Choose e.g. PostgreSQL or MySQL. It's also good to check if your hosting provider has any preferences. For example, Heroku prefers PostgreSQL.
   PostgreSQL has support for full-text search and support for extensions such as PostGIS that add support for location-based queries. Even if you start without a search engine, it may be that you need to introduce one at some point.
