JIRTBIOSS - Java Image Recognition Toolkit for Biosecurity - Is a software developed as my initial phase of Master of Computer Science thesis with its purpose being to enable processing of large number of images faster and efficiently. JIRTBIOSS server as front end for the Automated Object recognition (Animal detection) model to be developed in my thesis.

The software allows users to label images and store the labels into the database, there is also reporting functionality which allows users to extract specific information about images, e.g display all kangaroo images or extract image meta data including class labels and export to csv file.

Future integration include using openCV java wrapper to extract features from images and save the image feature vector into a database or csv file.

As an integral component of the wider discipline of systems engineering, CMâ€™s primary function is to provide and maintain an accurate status of the approved configuration of all technical equipment, as well as the incorporation status of all configuration changes throughout the lifecycle. The CM system must effectively support the management of seaworthiness and the provision of effective logistics support of all maritime equipment

KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF EFFECTIVE CM
1) Understanding CM Value
2) Monitor and improve CM process
3) Persue CM technical mastery
4) Communication
5) Adthere to the CM process
6) Manage CM priorities

WHAT IS CONFIGURATION CHANGE
Changes to the current approved configuration result from additions or alterations to the design affecting the functions, performance, physical build or usage envelope of an item, system or installation. These include:
1) the introduction of new items or systems, and removal of superseded items or systems to enhance capability or resolve a technical deficiency;
2) modifications to existing items resulting from a capability or technical deficiency;
3) Changes to the operational usage of the item that exceed the original design specifications;
4) the introduction of alternative or superseding items or parts;
5) the upgrading of software, including embedded software as may be found in data interfaces, sonar and radar systems;
6) introduction of new or additional role equipment, including weapons; and
7) approval of new standard repairs.

WHAT OF CM ACTIVITIES THAT DO NOT RESULT CHANGE TO APPROVED CONFIGURATION
1) approved variances to the configuration documentation;
2) changes to servicing or other maintenance procedures, provided these do not vary the approved performance requirements, e.g. testing to a lower standard;
3) extension or reduction of a maintenance interval;
4) role equipment being fitted or removed, within approved combinations (i.e. within approved space, weight ad mission-requirement combinations); or
5) incorporation of a standard repair.

WHAT ARE THE KEY CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESS IN CONFIG 
Create and Manage New PRs -> Impact assessment -->  Processing Variances,  --> Engineering Change Design and Approval, --> Implementing Engineering Changes
