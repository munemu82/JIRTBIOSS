JIRTBIOSS - Java Image Recognition Toolkit for Biosecurity - Is a software developed as my initial phase of Master of Computer Science thesis with its purpose being to enable processing of large number of images faster and efficiently. JIRTBIOSS server as front end for the Automated Object recognition (Animal detection) model to be developed in my thesis.

The software allows users to label images and store the labels into the database, there is also reporting functionality which allows users to extract specific information about images, e.g display all kangaroo images or extract image meta data including class labels and export to csv file.
